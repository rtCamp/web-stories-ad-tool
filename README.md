Web Stories Ad Creation Tool is designed to be accessed as a service where advertisers can create a high-quality story ad and download it for distribution. The tool is created by forking a version of [Web Stories Editor for WordPress](https://github.com/google/web-stories-wp) tailored to the Story Ad creation requirements as per the "[Best practices for creating a Web Story ad](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/develop/story_ads_best_practices/?format=stories)" document. This tool is a single page react app without any backend and therefore all assets and changes are stored locally only by using [web storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API).
